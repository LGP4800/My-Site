      <h2></h2>
      <p>In the last period I also had 2 bigger projects: a website for a fashion brand and a web application for a company in Italy. Due to their privacy policy, I am not allowed to post those pages.
Within the website for the fashion brand is presentation as well as buying their items.
In the Italian company, a test project was developed for employment, which has as its application directing the user to the nearest pharmacy to their current location, which is taken from the public dataset of pharmacies in Milan, based on latitude and longitude.</p>
